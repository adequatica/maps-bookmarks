  <name>Moscow Castles</name>
  <description>Moscow Kremlin is the most famous fortified complex in Russia. It is an iconic place for tourists, but there are many similar constructions of the same age in Moscow. Nowadays, most of them are considered religious sights, but they also represent castles in the sense of fortified medieval structures with defensive walls and towers.</description>

    <name>22. Bely Gorod Wall</name>
    <description>The defensive wall of Bely Gorod (White City) was erected between 1585 and 1593 and consists of 28 towers and 11 gates. 
In the 18th century, the wall lost its fortification value, and during Catherine the Great’s reign, it was demolished and replaced by a chain of boulevards. The names of the squares through the Boulevard Ring have preserved the names of the Bely Gorod’s gates. 
The only remaining basement of that wall is displayed at the Khokhlovskaya square.</description>

    <name>21. Izmaylovo Kremlin</name>
    <description>Built in 1996–2007 on the place of Izmaylovo Vernissage. 
It is not similar to the «kremlin» as a fortified complex because all the buildings are entirely new and imitate «old Moscow» architecture with many fake (but picturesque) elements. The place does not have historical value and is used for entertainment, a souvenir marketplace, and a flea market on weekends.</description>

After its foundation, the place was changed a few times according to the advantageous strategic position of the southern approaches to the city. The current location was established in 1561 during the reign of Ivan Vasilyevich the Terrible. The old walls were replaced with stone ones during the reign of Aleksey Mikhailovich from 1645 until he died in 1676. In 1983, the monastery became the headquarters of the Russian Orthodox Church.</description>

    <description>It was an additional defensive line around the Kremlin built from 1534 to 1539. It originally featured 13 towers and six gates. Unfortunately, the wall was demolished in the 1930s, and only two curtains remained. One of the two remaining parts is located near Zaryadye.</description>

    <name>1. Moscow Kremlin</name>
    <description>This site is out of the scope of the article because there is too much information about it. Nevertheless, it can not be mentioned. The contemporary Kremlin walls with «swallowtail» merlons were built by Italian architects (Antonio Gilardi, Marco Ruffo, and Pietro Antonio Solari) in 1485–1516.</description>
