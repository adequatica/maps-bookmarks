  <name>Moscow Castles</name>
  <description>Moscow Kremlin is the most known fortified complex in Russia. It is an iconic place for tourists, but there are a lot more similar constructions of the same age in Moscow. Nowadays most of them are considered as religious sights, but they also represent castles in the sense of fortified medieval structures with defensive walls and towers.</description>

    <description>The defencive wall of Bely Gorod (White City) was erected in 1585–1593 and consists of 28 towers and 11 gates. In the 18th century the wall lost its fortification value and during the reign of Catherine the Great the wall was demolished and replaced by a chain of boulevards. Names of the squares through Boulevard Ring have preserved the names of the Bely Gorod’s gates. The only remaining basement of the White City’s wall at the Khokhlovskaya square.</description>

    <name>21. Izmaylovo Kremlin</name>
    <description>Built in 1996–2007 on the place of Izmaylovo Vernissage. 
It does not have anything similar to «kremlin» as a fortified complex, because all buildings are completely new and just imitate «old Moscow» architecture with many fake (but picturesque) elements. The place does not have historical value and is used for entertainment, souvenir marketplace and a flea market on weekends.</description>

    <name>1. Moscow Kremlin</name>
    <description>This site is out of scope of the article, because there is too much information about it. Nevertheless, it can not be not mentioned. The contemporary Kremlin walls with «swallowtail» merlons were built by Italian architects (Antonio Gilardi, Marco Ruffo and Pietro Antonio Solari) in 1485–1516.</description>
