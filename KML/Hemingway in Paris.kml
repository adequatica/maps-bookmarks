  <name>Hemingway in Paris</name>
  <description>A definitive guide to Ernest Hemingway’s Paris. He lived in Paris from 1922 to 1928 and returned several times for short visits.</description>

    <name>66. Café de la Régence (now occupied by the Bureau National Marocain du Tourisme)</name>
    <description>This historic establishment was briefly mentioned in Hemigway’s column for Esquire: February 1934 «A Paris Letter», and it sounds like he was well aware of the mood prevailing in pre-war Paris. 
There is a contemporary «Café de la Régence» on the same block, but it borrowed only the name from the old place, which was closed in 1955 (nonetheless, a commemorative plaque remains on the building).</description>

    <description>I did not find any evidence of the existence of this cafe in the Boulevard des Italiens, where Hemingway met with Canadian boxer Larry Gains, but a café with the same name existed on 1, Boulevard des Capucines. It seems that the writer mixed up the Boulevards since the café is located at the very beginning of the Capucines, which adjoins the Italiens.</description>

In the introduction to the restored edition of «A Moveable Feast», Seán Hemingway writes: «In November 1956, the management of the Ritz Hotel in Paris convinced Ernest Hemingway to repossess two small steamer trunks that he stored there in March 1928. The trunks contained forgotten remnants from his first years in Paris».</description>

    <description>The Ritz Paris and especially its bar was «liberated» by Hemingway in August 1944. On the day of «liberation», he ordered 50 martinis for his band of irregular soldiers. 
In 1994, a small hotel’s bar was renamed the «Bar Hemingway» in his memory (he stayed in the Ritz in the mid-1950s). The easiest way inside is via the Rue Cambon entrance rather than going through the entire hotel from the main entrance.</description>

A biographer, A. E. Hotchner, quotes: «Hadley and Bumpy stayed in Shrumps and I said I’d return as soon as I got back from New York. I checked into the Hôtel Vénétia in Montparnasse. Pauline showed up the minute I stepped foot in Paris. Those four days she clung to me like ivy on a wall, taking me to nightclubs, Michelin restaurants, the Paris Opéra».</description>

In Chapter III of «The Sun Also Rises», Jake Barnes and Georgette come for dinner here. Instead of naming the place, Hemingway named the restaurant’s proprietor, Madame Lavigne. In the 20s, Monsieur and Madame Lavigne owned that place. Moreover, the first version of the manuscript contained more details: «By this time we were on the Boulevard Montparnasse, and I called to the cocher to stop at Lavigne’s restaurant, Le Negre de Toulouse.»</description>

    <description>Along with the Dôme, the «Café de la Rotonde» was an extremely popular café among writers and painters (especially Pablo Picasso). Of course it was criticized by Hemingway for its public. 
In Chapter VI of «The Sun Also Rises», he showed the indifference of local taxi drivers to the public gathering there. 
He fully expressed his dismissive attitude towards the public of this cafe in a journalistic article American Bohemians in Paris a Weird Lot for Toronto Star Weekly. 
These days it remains a fashionable place — Emmanuel Macron celebrating the results of the first round of the 2017 French presidential election at the Rôtonde.</description>

Hemingway describes his way to the brasserie in great detail in «Hunger Was Good Discipline»: starting from Avenue de l’Observatoire → Jardin du Luxembourg → narrow Rue Férou → Place Saint-Sulpice «were still no restaurants, only the quiet square with its benches and trees» → Rue de l’Odéon → Brasserie Lipp. 
And the way back to his «office»: Brasserie Lipp → Rue Bonaparte → Rue Guynemer → Rue d’Assas → Rue Notre Dame des Champs → La Closerie Des Lilas.</description>

    <description>All of the cafes of that time are now busy and overpriced tourist spots. Even then, Hemingway thought the same about popular places such as Le Dôme, La Rotonde, Le Select, and La Coupole. He found his own quiet and cozy cafe for work out of reach from the crowds of American expats. He often dined here and was acquainted with all the waiters. 
The Closerie is the setting place of the stories «Ford Maddox Ford and the Devil’s Disciple» and «Evan Shipman at the Lilas». It is also mentioned in «Une Génération Perdue» and «Scott Fitzgerald». It was here that Scott begged Ernest to read his new novel «The Great Gatsby». Also, most of the novel «The Sun Also Rises» was written here. 
Today, the tables in the bar are decorated with brass plates with the names of authors who drank there, including «Ernest Hemingway».</description>

The events that happened to Ralph Cheever Dunning, «a poet who smoked opium and forgot to eat», from the story «An Agent of Evil», took place in this place.</description>

    <description>At the end of 1923, Hemingways returned to America to have his first child. As soon as Mr. Bumby was strong enough for the transatlantic voyage, they returned to Paris on February 8, 1924. 
Before Hemingway’s arrival, Ezra Pound and his wife offered to share their large ground-floor apartment at 70 rue Notre-Dame-des-Champs. Ernest accepted, but Hadley found the Pounds’ place dark and claustrophobic. For their new home, they chose a second-floor apartment at № 113 on the same street. A month’s rent was 650 francs (almost three times what they had paid on Cardinal-Lemoine), the apartment had no electricity, and there was a sawmill workshop on the ground floor. But at the same time, the space was better, the location was closer to Gertrude Stein’s salon, Luxembourg Garden, and a few steps from an unspoiled café called La Closerie de Lilas.</description>

    <description>Hemingway’s newsman friend, Bill Bird, purchased an ancient Mathieu hand press and started a printing shop on the Île Saint-Louis island in 1922. Later, he provided office accommodation to Ford Madox Ford for the Transatlantic Review. Ernest was often there, but he did not like Ford for personal and financial reasons. 
On the same island, there was a Madame Lecomte restaurant where Jake Barnes and Bill Gorton from «The Sun Also Rises» had dinner. It could probably be a small restaurant, «Au Rendez-Vous des Mariniers», which was not preserved at the time.</description>

In July 1942, French police, under Nazi orders, used the velodrome to hold 13000 Jews before deporting them to concentration camps. A plaque on the 7 Rue Nélaton (former velodrome place) serves as a memorial of this incident.</description>

After that they «had come out of the gateway through the Louvre and crossed the street outside and were standing on the bridge leaning on the stone and looking down at the river». The bridge — is a pedestrian bridge Pont des Arts.</description>

    <description>Gare du Nord met Ernest Hemingway on his very first visit to Paris in May 1918, when he arrived in Europe on the way to the WWI Italian front. 
Later, with Hadley, he took the train from this station to the suburbs to go to the horse races at Enghien or Auteuil. On race days in the 1920s, special trains ran straight through to the tracks.</description>

    <description>Hemingway actively used railways as a foreign correspondent for the Toronto Star Weekly newspaper. From there, he took the Oriental Express for the four-day ride to Constantinople to cover the Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922) and also took a train to Lyon to pick up Scott Fitzerald’s car. 
This place is also associated with a bad story when Ernest’s first manuscripts were stolen from Hadley because they traveled from here to Switzerland for skiing.</description>

According to Hemingway’s biographer, Michael Reynolds, there is no evidence that he rented a writing room. This seems to be fiction, mentioned only in «A Moveable Feast».</description>

    <name>4. 1st apartment</name>
    <description>Hemingways moved into an apartment on the fourth floor on January 9, 1922, and lived there until August 1923 (the interior is closed to the public). Lewis Galantière, one of Sherwood Anderson’s friends, helped them to find a room. Ernest wrote to his parents that the apartment was «the jolliest place you ever saw. We rented it furnished for 250 francs a month, about 18 dollars. It is on top of a high hill in the very oldest part of Paris. The nicest part of the Latin Quarter». Actually, it consisted of only two rooms and a tiny kitchen, it was not convenient to a Metro stop and was in a poor working-class neighborhood. The reason for this choice was that the price was right, while a nicely furnished apartment around Luxembourg Gardens and Montparnasse cost 1000 francs or 85 dollars a month. 
On the ground floor of the same building, there was a workmen’s dance hall, or Bal Musette (used to be called «Bal au Printemps», but now no longer exists). Sometimes Hemingways went down to take a whirl, but unfortunately, the clamor, compounded by annoying accordion music, was there every night.</description>

    <description>On December 20, 1921, Ernest Hemingway, at the age of 22, and his wife Hadley came to Paris for the first time. Until they found an apartment, they checked into the Hôtel Jacob et Angleterre in room № 14. The hotel was recommended to them by Sherwood Anderson, who stayed there the previous fall. Today, Hôtel d’Angleterre still allows guests to stay in this room, and a glass case in the lobby records Hemingway’s time there.</description>
