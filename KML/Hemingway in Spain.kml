    <description>In 1959 «Don Ernesto» arrived in Spain and stayed at «La Cónsula», a farm that was owned by the American couple Bill and Annie Davis. He had a great time meeting old friends and making outings to watch bullfights. He came back here alone the following summer, but soon he left because of a bad mood (in fact, he fell into a manic listlessness).</description>

Actually, during the Spanish Civil war Hemingway traveled to numerous cities and villages on the Republican part of the front. It could be the subject of a separate article; there are whole books on this topic.</description>

Puente de La Cantina is the most likely to be the one, because it has a strategic location over the river Eresma to conquer Segovia (Hemingway was especially meticulous in military matters). Hemingway went back to Guadarrama Mountains in the 1950s and was photographed against the bridge in the background.</description>

    <description>Technically, Hendaye is the territory of France, but historically it is a part of Basque Country. Hemingway came here many times, especially in the 1920s. He stayed at various modest hotels, here are just those that are met in biographies: Hotel Grand in 1925, Hotel Barron and Ondarraitz Hotel in 1929, and even rented a small cottage in 1931. Unfortunately, I did not find any information about their current status. 
What is known for certain is that he came here to the beach. In 1927 he wrote to Scott Fitzgerald: «We drove here from Madrid in a day – Hendaye-Plage».</description>

    <description>In summer 1925 Ernest Hemingway with Hadley, Donald Ogden Stewart, Duff Twysden and Pat Guthrie, Garold Loeb and Bill Smith stayed at Hotel Quintana – a bullfighter’s hotel run by Juanito Quintana. Hemingway chose this hotel during all his subsequent visits to Pamplona in 1925, 1926, 1927, 1929 and 1931. 
1925 was a momentous year for Hemingway. His third Sanfermines formed the basis of his first novel «The Sun Also Rises» (published in the United Kingdom under the title «Fiesta») and Hotel Quintana dubbed «Hotel Montoya» in the novel.</description>

Some researchers assume that there is no evidence of his stay in this hotel, but according to other information he stood there in a suite № 217. After the recent renovation, the former room № 217 is now № 201 (Suite de Hemingway). Ernest Hemingway’s grandson, John Hemingway, visited Hotel La Perla during San Fermín 2014.</description>

    <description>Ernest Hemingway came to Pamplona (Iruña in Basque language) for the first time in July 1923. He came to the Festival of San Fermín with his first wife Hadley Richardson. Headly was not very impressed by bullfights, but Ernest was. In the article published on 27 October 1923 in «The Toronto Star Weekly» he described his first morning: «We followed the crowd that was leaving through a narrow gate on the walls towards a yellowish, flat and empty field, where the new and white bull ring stands: it was packed. Once the bulls have been locked in their pen, the aficionado bullfight – vaquillas, begins». 
Next year (1924) he took part in the running of the bulls and a year later (1925) he tried his hand in amateur bullfights, which were held every morning during the festival.</description>

    <description>This cocktail bar was popular among international journalists in the 1930s, and was frequented by Ernest Hemingway. According to him, it was «the place to start an evening from, all right, and we had all started some fine ones from there».

    <description>In early June 1923 Ernest Hemingway and his friend Robert McAlmon arrived in Madrid on the Sud Express train. They agreed to meet here with their third companion Bill Bird. After Madrid they planned to visit Seville, Ronda, Granada, go back to Madrid and return to Paris in the third week of June. But firstly, they had to see a bullfighting, which was colorfully described to Hemingway by his friend Henry «Mike» Strater. 
Hemingway and McAlmon attend a bullfight at the Plaza de Toros de la Fuente del Berro, which was demolished in 1934. A modern bullfighting ring Las Ventas was opened in 1931 and was visited by Hemingway in the 1930s and 1950s. According to some expats, he liked sitting in the 9th section.</description>
