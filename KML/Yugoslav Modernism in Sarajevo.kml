  <name>Yugoslav Modernism in Sarajevo</name>
  <description>The majority of buildings of the socialist modernism era in Sarajevo are located in Novo Sarajevo, and they are primarily residential blocks. However, the most iconic Sarajevo buildings of this period are located somewhere between an old Austro-Hungarian part of the city and a new one. 
I included a couple of postmodernist buildings of the late 80s, which also have remarkable elements of modernism.</description>

This is an atypical building for the last years of the existence of socialist Yugoslavia and is a perfect example of a «classic» postmodern building.</description>

    <name>17. Holiday Inn Hotel (postmodernism)</name>
    <description>Years of construction: 1982–1983, designed by Bosnian architect Ivan Štraus. 
The hotel was opened a year before the 1984 Winter Olympics and was criticized for its bright facade (what makes a building postmodern). During the war in the 1990s, the hotel became a headquarters for foreign journalists, and from time to time, it was the only place with food, water, and electricity. 
After several years of operating after the war, the hotel went bankrupt and lost its «Holiday Inn» brand license. It was reopened in 2016 under the Holiday Hotel name.</description>
