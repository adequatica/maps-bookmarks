    <name>Yukki [closed], Saint Petersburg, Russia</name>
    <description>It was the only mountainboard spot in Saint Petersburg (actually, 30 kilometers north of the city). It started in 2008 and grew bigger and bigger every season. In 2010 it got huge big-airs which were reused in winter for snowboarding. The last competition in Yukki (aka Rainbow Park) was in 2013, and the next season it was demolished by the landlord.</description>

    <name>Winterberg [partly closed], Germany</name>
    <description>The magnificent mountainboard park was built in 2009 on a slope of a ski resort in an attempt to attract riders during summertime. Unfortunately, mountainboarding became unprofitable, and the park was demolished in 2012. I was lucky enough to visit it two times: in 2010 and 2011. There was the best series of mountainboard jumps I’ve ever ridden. 
Despite the loss of the freestyle section, the bike track «Black Hole» in the woods is still ridable.</description>

    <name>Willingen, Germany</name>
    <description>I was there only for competition in 2011, and as local riders say, they also rarely use it. This is a bike track that partially fits for mountainboarding. It’s not fast but has a few interesting rollers and a nice gravel surface. There haven’t been any events since that time.</description>

    <name>Wanyi Park, Belgium</name>
    <description>This is the best and the oldest mountainboard resort in Europe (opened in 2005). I came here many times and always had fun regardless of the weather. The park has a series of jumps with big air, jibbing obstacles that change from season to season, a boardercross track (not for beginners), a foam pit, a wide slope (for beginners), babylift, and a camping site. 
During the past seasons, Wanyi operated as a «mountainboard center» with training courses for kids and beginners every weekend.</description>

    <name>Trilhas do Olimpo, Petropolis, Brazil</name>
    <description>I was there during the trip in 2013 and didn’t know about this park before going to Brazil. It’s totally a great place for relaxing and riding on a mountainboard. There are two tracks: the first for beginners and the second for experienced riders. 
As far as I know, the park hasn’t changed much over time and is used mostly by bikers. 
Freestyle section: slopestyle course, big air, and a pump track!</description>

    <name>Swell [private], Porto Alegre, Brazil</name>
    <description>The park is located on the backyard slope of Swell skatepark. It is the second Brazilian mountainboard park that was abandoned in 2013. It seems to be that I was the first rider who rode there on a mountainboard in a couple of years, but even so, the track was very speedy. Everything else was the same as in the late ’00s. 
Freestyle section: big air with quarterpipe in poor condition, concrete skateboard bowls.</description>

    <name>Shambhala, Sopot, Bulgaria</name>
    <description>I visited this track only to take part in the boardercross competition, but it wasn’t a mountainboard park. It was an ordinary bikecross track: low rollers, easy turns, not much speed, and gravel surface. There is no info about any events in Bulgaria since then.</description>

    <description>I visited this park during a tour around the Pyrenees in the spring of 2013. The local mountainboard community has its own piece of a big bike park. This place is only for freestyle: small big air and jibbing figures. Some bike parts of the track are also available for mountainboarding.</description>

    <name>Payolle, France</name>
    <description>It’s the home spot of Diego Anderson — ex-president of the International Mountainboard Association. The park is located just on the roadside in the Pyrenees mountains. It’s mostly a freestyle place: big air, quarterpipe, and jibbing figures. I visited it in 2013, and it seems like it hasn’t changed at all since its construction. There has been no news about any activity in that park since that time.</description>

    <name>Orekhovo, Moscow, Russia</name>
    <description>It’s the opening spot of an old-school mountainboard video, «8 Inchez». The bike track was built in its current shape in 2004 and became suitable for mountainboarding. Local mountainboarders ride there every season, but the golden years of the sport are over, and the last competition was held in 2013. 
Up to date, it consists of a bike track for one rider, big air on the course, and a series of two dirt jumps.</description>

    <description>A legendary place — the oldest mountainboard park in the world. There are two different parks in one place: a cozy home spot with jumps, rails, and quarterpipe and the full-length boardercross track on a wide slope with big air. 
The park is still active as a mountainboard resort and hosts local events. It appears in the latest video for «4 Down project».</description>

    <description>The exact coordinates of the park are classified, and it’s not possible to ride there without locals. When I was there in 2013 out of season, the park was in perfect condition. It’s not a boardercross track or freestyle park, it’s all in one and one of the greatest things made for mountainboarding. Unfortunately, there is no news, photos, or videos from there except one.</description>

    <description>My photos of the place are outdated because, after the visit in 2013, the track was completely rebuilt the next year. This resort has a ski lift, wide grass slope, asphalt longboard track, and a boardercross track which is shared with bikers. After the World Championships 2015, local riders are planning to rebuild a few parts of the track to make it safer.</description>

    <name>El SoT Vilamajor, Barcelona, Spain</name>
    <description>This spot is located in the countryside, less than an hour’s drive from Barcelona, and operates on demand. When I came there in the middle of the summer of 2015, the track and jumps were overgrown with dry grass but became fully ridable just after a few runs and looked the same as a long time ago. It has a freestyle section: jumps, rails for jibbing, dirt quarterpipe, and big air. 
From Barcelona, you need to take a Ridalies train to Sant Celoni from Sants Estació or Passeig de Gràcia. The destination station is Llinars del Vallès.</description>

    <name>Dirt Dessert, Kranj, Slovenia</name>
    <description>It’s one of the best tracks I’ve ever ridden at the World Championships. It doesn’t feel overspeed and you can also try different trajectories and practice various techniques of passing curves and rollers. You can’t see the full track, because it is laid in the coniferous forests, so you must do a few runs to get used to it. 
The freestyle section consists of a series of two big airs.</description>

    <name>Compiegne, France</name>
    <description>Actually, this park isn’t located in Compiegne, it’s near Venette (Compiegne’s suburb). I visited Compiegne during one of my first Euro tours in 2011, then on the way to Bretagne in 2013, and on the World Mountainboard Championships in 2017. 
Every time the place was changed a little bit, but before the world championships, the boardercross track was completely rebuilt, and freestyle jumps became bigger. The freestyle section has a series of big airs for all levels of riders, a quarterpipe, rails for jibbing, a foam pit, and a skate ramp. The spot is shared with bikers.</description>

    <description>Unfortunately, the park was abandoned when I visited it in 2013. It was built in the private fazenda and hasn’t changed since the late 00’s. Maybe it is still rideable because the last time the dirt was smooth and banked turns kept their shape. There is no info about any events in South Brazil. 
Freestyle section: big air with wooden rollin.</description>

    <name>Bukovac, Novi Sad, Serbia</name>
    <description>After my first visit in 2011, I returned here every time I could. In 2018 the Bukovac’s track celebrated its 10-year anniversary: it developed from a local spot to the host of four World Boardercross Championships in 2013, 2014, 2016, and 2019. 
The full-length track operates only during annual competitions, but the top part of it could be ridden all season. The last part of the track is extremely fast and becomes faster and faster every year. The overall length of the track is over 800 m. Watch out for thorns growing on the roadsides. 
In 2018 the track got a bridge! 
Freestyle section: one concrete big air (unfortunately with a little bit flat landing). A part of the park is shared with bikers.</description>

    <name>Arzano, Bretagne, France</name>
    <description>I visited Arzano during one of the Euro tours in 2013. The track is hidden in the woods, so it’s not wide, but comfortable for riding even at a high speed. It has funny obstacles all along and has a really scary s-turn called «Pif Paf» on the top. According to a video from the last event, the spot hasn’t changed much. 
Freestyle section: big air and a series of jumps, quarterpipe, and rails for jibbing.</description>
