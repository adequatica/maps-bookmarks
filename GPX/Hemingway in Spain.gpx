  <desc>Ernest Hemingway came to Pamplona (Iruña in Basque language) for the first time in July 1923. He came to the Festival of San Fermín with his first wife Hadley Richardson. Headly was not very impressed by bullfights, but Ernest was. In the article published on 27 October 1923 in «The Toronto Star Weekly» he described his first morning: «We followed the crowd that was leaving through a narrow gate on the walls towards a yellowish, flat and empty field, where the new and white bull ring stands: it was packed. Once the bulls have been locked in their pen, the aficionado bullfight – vaquillas, begins». 
Next year (1924) he took part in the running of the bulls and a year later (1925) he tried his hand in amateur bullfights, which were held every morning during the festival.</desc>
