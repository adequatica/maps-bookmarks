  <desc>Pyotr Alexeyevich Kropotkin was born on December 9, 1842 into an aristocratic family in a typical manor house built by his grandmother at the beginning of the XIX century. In this period, such mansions were built up throughout the south-western part of Moscow and inhabited mainly by the nobility.
He lived in this house only for the first seven or eight years of his life. When his father, Prince Alexey Petrovich Kropotkin, married for the second time after the death of his first wife from consumption, he sold this house and bought another, in Malyy Levshinskiy lane.</desc>
