The Closerie is the setting place of the stories «Ford Maddox Ford and the Devil’s Disciple» and «Evan Shipman at the Lilas», it is also mentioned in «Une Génération Perdue» and «Scott Fitzgerald». It was here that Scott begged Ernest to read his new novel «The Great Gatsby». Also most of the novel «The Sun Also Rises» was written here.

Before Hemingways arrival Ezra Pound and his wife offered them to share their large ground-floor apartment at 70 rue Notre-Dame-des-Champs. Ernest accepted, but Hadley found the Pounds’ place dark and claustrophobic. For their new home they chose a second floor apartment at No. 113 of the same street. A month’s rent was 650 francs (almost three times what they had paid on Cardinal-Lemoine), the apartment had no electricity and there was a sawmill workshop on the ground floor.

They thought about the theory that Arc du Carrousel, Arc de Triomphe and Porta Sempione in Milan are standing in one line. 
After that they «had come out of the gateway through the Louvre and crossed the street outside and were standing on the bridge leaning on the stone and looking down at the river.» The bridge — is a pedestrian bridge Pont des Arts.</desc>

  <desc>For some time in Paris, Hemingway was passionate about horse racing. During the racing season he often bet on two tracks: Auteuil and Enghien. 
Enghien is one of the oldest race tracks in France. Its special feature is the ability to host two different disciplines in one day: flat racings and steeplechase.</desc>

This place is also associated with a bad story, when Ernest’s first manuscripts were stolen from Hadley, because they traveled from here to Switzerland for skiing.</desc>

  <desc>Hemingways moved into an apartment on the fourth floor on January 9, 1922, and lived there until August 1923 (the interior is closed to the public). Lewis Galantière, one of Sherwood Anderson’s friends, helped them to find a room. Ernest wrote to his parents that the apartment was «the jolliest place you ever saw. We rented it furnished for 250 francs a month, about 18 dollars. It is on top of a high hill in the very oldest part of Paris. The nicest part of the Latin Quarter.» Actually it consisted of only two rooms and a tiny kitchen, it was not convenient to a Metro stop and was in a poor working-class neighborhood. The reason for this choice was that the price was right, while a nicely furnished apartment around Luxembourg Gardens and Montparnasse cost 1000 francs or 85 dollars a month. 
At the ground floor of the same building, there was a workmen’s dance hall, or Bal Musette (used to be called «Bal au Printemps», but now no longer exists). Sometimes Hamingways went down to take a whirl, but unfortunately the clamor compounded by annoying accordion music was there every night.</desc>

  <desc>On December 20, 1921, Ernest Hemingway at the age of 22, with his wife Hadley came to Paris for the first time. Until they found an apartment, they checked into the Hôtel Jacob et Angleterre in room №14. The hotel was recommended to them by Sherwood Anderson who stayed there the previous fall. Today, Hôtel d’Angleterre still allows guests to stay in this room and a glass case in the lobby records Hemingway’s time there.</desc>
