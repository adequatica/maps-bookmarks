  <desc>From the date of its construction in 537, and until 1453, it served as an Orthodox cathedral, except between 1204 and 1261, when it was converted by the Forth Crusaders to a Roman Catholic cathedral under the Latin Empire. The building was later converted into an Ottoman mosque from 1453 until 1931. It was then secularized and opened as a museum on 1 February 1935. Famous in particular for its massive dome, it is considered the epitome of Byzantine architecture. It remained the world's largest cathedral for nearly a thousand years, until Seville Cathedral was completed in 1520.</desc>

  <desc>The cistern was built in the 6th century during the reign (527–565) of Byzantine Emperor Justinian I. This cistern is an underground chamber approximately 138 meters by 65 meters (about 9,800 square meters in area) and capable of holding 80,000 cubic meters of water. The ceiling is supported by a forest of 336 marble columns, each 9 metres high, arranged in 12 rows of 28 columns each spaced 5 metres apart. The cistern has the capacity to store 100,000 tons of water.</desc>

  <desc>The Walls of Constantinople was built in the 5th century. Although the other sections of the walls were less elaborate, when well-manned, they were almost impregnable for any medieval besieger, saving the city, and the Byzantine Empire with it. The advent of gunpowder siege cannons rendered the fortifications vulnerable. Ultimately the city fell from sheer weight of numbers of the Ottoman forces in 1453 after a six-week siege. The walls were largely maintained intact during most of the Ottoman period, until sections began to be dismantled in the 19th century, as the city outgrew its medieval boundaries, but many parts of the walls survived and are still standing today.</desc>

  <desc>The Romanesque style tower was built as Christea Turris (Tower of Christ) in 1348 during an expansion of the Genoese colony in Constantinople. It was the tallest building in Istanbul at 66.9 m (51.65 m at the observation deck) when it was built. The upper section of the tower was modified in several restorations during the Ottoman period when it was used as an observation tower for spotting fires.</desc>

  <desc>There are several documents suggesting the name of the bazaar was first «New Bazaar». The building itself is part of the complex of the New Mosque, and got its name «Egyptian Bazaar» because it was built with the revenues from the Ottoman eyalet of Egypt in 1660. The bazaar was (and still is) the center for spice trade, Turkish delight and other sweets.</desc>
