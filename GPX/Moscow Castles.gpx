It does not have anything similar to «kremlin» as a fortified complex, because all buildings are completely new and just imitate «old Moscow» architecture with many fake (but picturesque) elements. The place does not have historical value and is used for entertainment, souvenir marketplace and a flea market on weekends.</desc>
